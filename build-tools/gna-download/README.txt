Clansuite Webinstaller Instructions:

      1. Manually upload "webinstaller.php" to your webserver
         or if you got SSH / Shell Access use:
         wget http://download.gna.org/clansuite/webinstaller.php

      2. Browse to http://yourserverdomain.com/yourdirectoryname/webinstaller.php to start the webinstaller.

      3. Follow the instructions.

      4. Once the webinstaller is finished, follow the link to the Clansuite Installer.
         The Installation-Application will guide you in several steps through the installation of Clansuite.

      5. Finally remove the "webinstaller.php" file from your server.

Important Note:

      Webinstaller transfers and extracts Clansuite on your webserver.
      It fetches a compressed archive file into the directory of the webinstaller.
      When uncompressing this archive, a new folder named "/clansuite" will be
      created, containing all web-application data. If you have FTP or Shell Access,
      we recommend extracting the archive yourself of course.
