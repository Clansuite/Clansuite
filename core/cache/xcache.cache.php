/**
 * Clansuite Cache Handler for Xcache
 *
 * XCache is a open-source opcode cacher, which means that it accelerates the performance of PHP on servers.
 * It optimizes performance by removing the compilation time of PHP scripts by caching the compiled state of
 * PHP scripts into the shm (RAM) and uses the compiled version straight from the RAM. This will increase
 * the rate of page generation time by up to 5 times as it also optimizes many other aspects of php scripts
 * and reduce serverload.
 * The XCache project is lead by mOo who is also a developer of the Lighttpd, the Webserver also known as lighty.
