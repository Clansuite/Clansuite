/**
 * Clansuite Core Class for Formular Handling
 *
 * The Formular Object provides methods to deal with the following problem:
 *
 * Normally you would define your form on html side. When the form gets submitted
 * you would perform a server-side validation on the incomming formdata against
 * certain validation rules. If your system is one of the better ones, you would
 * add these validations also on client-side as an useability enhancement.
 *
 * Problem: 
 * This means that you have to implement the validation rules and validation methods two times.
 * One time via javascript on client-side, one time via php on server-side.
 *
 * Clansuite's formhandling abstracts the form generation and solves the problem described above.
 *
 * The formular handling process can be described as the following:
 *
 * 1) Formcreation
 *    The formular is defined/described only one-time in php and xml.
 *    
 *    The form-definition/description contains:
 *    a) Elements
 *    b) Attributes
 *    c) Validation rules
 *    d) Filters
 *
 * 2) Transformation / Generation
 *    The formular definition is then transformed into a valid html/xhtml/xml document segment
 *    with client-side validation rules and methods applied.
 *
 *    The form contains:
 *    a) Formular
 *    b) Client-side formular validation rules
 *    c) Client-side formular validation methods
 *
 * 3) The generated form is ready for getting embedded into the template/document providing the formular.
 *
 * Form Workflow 
 *
 *    a) Embed formular
 *       -> Perform client-side validation while data is collected from user
 *       -> If validation is ok:
 *    b) Submit
 *       -> Perform server-side validation on incomming data
 *       -> If validation is ok:
 *          -> Save Data !
 *       -> Else
 *    c) Repopulate formfields on submission error
 *       -> goto a)
