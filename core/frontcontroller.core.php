/**
 * Clansuite FrontController
 *
 * It's basically a FrontController (which should better be named RequestController)
 * with fassade (addPreFilter, addPostFilter) to both filtermanagers / filterchains on top.
 *
 * It's tasks are:
 * 1. intercepts all requests made by the client to the web server through central "index.php"
 * 2. gets all needed "pre action processing" things like Auth, Sessions, Logging, whatever... pluggable or not.
 * 3. decides then, which ModuleController we must dynamically invoking to process the request
 *
 * The constructor takes the ModuleController_Resolver_Interface (so it's an implementation against an interface),
 * the ActionController_Resolver_Interface (so it's again an implementation against an interface)
 * and the Dependency Injector.
