     * Magic Method __call()
     *
     * When a method call to the current decorator is not defined, it is catched by __call().
     * So the purpose of this method is to delegate method calls to the different decorators.
     * This result is, that you have the full combination of methods of the nested decorators
     * available, without losing methods.
     *
     * Several Performance-Issues:
     * 1) costs for calling __call
     * 2) costs for calling call_user_func_array()
     *    All we can do is to use our semi-micro optimization: Clansuite_Loader::callMethod().
     * 3) the nested call stack itself: the bigger the stack, the slower it becomes.
