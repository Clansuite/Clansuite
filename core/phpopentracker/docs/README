INSTALLATION

  Either copy the phpOpenTracker/ directory to a directory that is
  listed in your php.ini's include_path directive, or - and this is
  the prefered way - use the PEAR Installer to install the
  phpOpenTracker sources to your PHP library directory

    pear install phpOpenTracker-X.X.X.tar.gz

  If you already installed a previous version of phpOpenTracker, you
  may want to upgrade it with  

    pear upgrade phpOpenTracker-X.X.X.tar.gz

  You should now be able, for instance, to use the following lines
  of code to invoke the phpOpenTracker Logging Engine:

    <?php
    require_once 'phpOpenTracker.php';
    phpOpenTracker::log();
    ?>

  If you cannot install, either by hand, or using the PEAR Installer, 
  to a directory that is set up as an include_path, you will need
  to specify the full path to the phpOpenTracker.php file:

    <?php
    require_once '/path/to/phpOpenTracker.php';
    phpOpenTracker::log();
    ?>
