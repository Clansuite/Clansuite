Use the oracle.sql file to create the Oracle objects in an existing schema.

It is recommended for high-traffic systems to use different tablespaces and 
devices to store the Oracle objects.

Set the parameteres in pot_oracle.sh to match your environment and execute the 
script as $ORACLE_OWNER. You may also perform all the actions manually.
