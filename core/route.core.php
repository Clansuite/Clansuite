/**
 * Clansuite_Route
 *
 * Purpose: Clansuite_Route does URL Formating and internal Rewriting.
 * The URL is segmented and restructured to fit the internal route to a controller.
 * The internal routes are described in a central routing configuration file (whitelist).
 * On Installation the routes are added (add_url_route), on deinstallation removed (del_url_route).
 *
 * There are two different URL Formatings allowed:
 * 1. Slashes as Segment Dividers-Style, like so: /mod/sub/action/id
 * 2. Fake HTML File Request or SMF-Style, like so: /mod.sub.action.id.html
