/*
 * Smarty plugin
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * Type:	outputfilter
 * Name:	gzip
 * Version:	0.1
 * Date:	2003-02-13
 * Author:	Joscha Feth, joscha@feth.com
 * Purpose:	gzip the output, before it is sent to the client
 *          ATTENTION: this filter does only work if caching is disabled,
 *			because the cached page would be gzipped and it seems as Smarty
 *			can not (yet) handle that, even if you send the Content-Encoding yourself.
 *			(However, you need not worry about this, if caching is enabled, this filter just returns the source
 *			without compression.)
 *			Why does it not work with caching (yet)?
 *			----------------------------------------
 *			This is because of Smarty adds some information to the beginning of a cached page in ASCII
 *			format.
 *			Also the file should then be opened in "rb" mode on windows, right now it is (still) opened
 *			in "normal" "r" mode.
 * Install:  Drop into the plugin directory, call 
 *           $smarty->load_filter('output','gzip');
 *           from application.
