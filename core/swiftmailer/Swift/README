The file Swift_POP3_SMTP_Authenticator_.php deliberately ends with
the underscore character so that Swift does not auto-load it.
POP3 Before SMTP Authentication is not advertised by the SMTP server
and the authenticator also needs constructor parameters.

Load this file manually if you need POP Before SMTP authentication.
