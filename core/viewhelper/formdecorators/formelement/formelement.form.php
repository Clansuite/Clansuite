 * Clansuite_Formelement_Decorator_Formelement
 *
 * This decorator decorates a formelement (A) with another formelement (B).
 *
 * By doing this you could Live without formdecorators is easy. You would add the two formelements (A+B) to a form.
 * But consider a situation where you want to add only formelement (A) to the form.
 * From inside formelement (A) you can't reach the form to add another formelement (B).
 * But you can reach the addDecorator() method. And at this point this class comes in.
 * It utilizes Clansuite_Form::formelementFactory to get the formelement (B).
