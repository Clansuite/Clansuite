  What is it?
  -----------

    Clansuite is is just another php based content management system, but this one is
    state-of-the-art and especially for esport teams. It is designed to effectively manage
    and administrate team-ressources, people, processes and information on the web.

    Because of it's modular design approach, it could be used by everyone demanding a
    feature-rich and easy to maintain content management system.

    It's even suitable for "esport" and "real-life" sports teams, associations,
    personal web pages, freelancers or to create the business website for your company.

 	Clansuite is written in PHP and should run under PHP5.2+.

  Why?
  ----

    Why another clanscript when there are already bxcp, clansphere, webspell, triggertg,
    cmpro and others? Because all those scripts have limitations that the clansuite
    development team could not live with when building a clan-website:

      As webmaster and orga of an e-sports team named "knd-squad" i used various cms over
    the years, most of them heavily modified by myself to fit our administrative needs and
    to take some work out of our hands.

      Long time ago, I contributed some of my ideas and useful (imo) features to different
    clan-related cms communities, but found them only little organized, focused on un-
    needed things while being unable to help in development of important features or
    realize basic user-requests.

    As I began to implement add-on's on my own, i found myself always working on the
    frame-level, reaching the borders of those cms. Too often they were lacking essential
    features while featuring essential design flaws to build upon. While PHP's language
    features and web-techniques evolved, these scripts did not. Some of my idea's couldn't
    be implemented easily, other ones ended too often on my sketchpad.

    In the end i decided to start a e-sport dedicated cms from scratch. Clansuite was born.

      We hope that Clansuite is different. It's developed as a framework-oriented CMS, but
    still not being a framework at all.

      Clansuite is modular. This means that you can easily extend features by adding new
    modules. You can add them "manually via ftp" or use the Admin Control Panel to install
    "over the web" from the Clansuite HQ-Server.

      My objective is to develop a community surrounded, open-source cms/portal-system,
    focused on essential administrative needs for both, e-sports and real-life sports teams,
    while keeping simplicity and maintainabilty in mind.
