Intention:

The idea of libacts2 is to replace the CyTS class with a new flexible fast
and reliable object-oriented library which meets the requirements of todays
PHP developers.

The result should be simple and efficient.



Requirements:

PHP >= 5.1



How to start:

Just have a look at the documentation or if you like "learning by doing" have
a look at the examples directory.



Which files do I need to use libacts2 in my own projects:

You neeed The file "Absurd.php" and the directory "Absurd" with all
of its subdirectories and files. In your PHP application you only need
to include / require the "Absurd.php" the rest should be done automatically.



Where to report bugs, feature requests, ...:

Please send them to libacts2 [at] absurdcoding [dot] org
Any support related questions here will be ignored.



Where to get the latest developer version:

The latest version can alway be found in the subversion repositories of
absurdcoding.org. You can checkout the latest version by using

svn co svn://svn.absurdcoding.org/libacts2/trunk



How to build the manual:

Install phpdocumentor on your machine if you have not already done it by typing

pear install phpdocumentor

now use the "makedocs" script to build the documentation.
