== PHP_Debug History ===========================================================

PHP_Debug has started like this :

<?php
$tab = "<table width=100%>";

function dbg($str)
{
	$tab .= "<tr><td>$str</td></tr>">;
}

...

echo $tab. '</table>';
?>

I have improved it a little... :)
Since i code, i love to have lots of trace and debug informations in my apps,
that's why i decided to write this class. If you have any ideas, suggestions 
to do... You can use the sourceforge interface or feel free to mail me.
