        * Usage of method: setTemplate($templatename)
        *
        * 1. you can specify a complete template-filename (including its path)
        * 2. if you NOT use this method,
        * we try to automatically detect the template-file by using module and action as templatename.
        *
        * the template lookup will take place in the following paths:
        *    a) in the activated "layout theme" folder (according to the user-session)
        *        example: usertheme = "standard" and $this->template = 'modulename/filename.tpl';
        *         then lookup of template in /standard/modulename/filename.tpl
        *    b) the modul-directory/templatefolder/rendererfolder/actionname.tpl
        *
        * As a result of this direct connection of URL to TPL, it's possible to
        * code in a very straightforward way:  index.php?mod=something&action=any
        * would result in a template-search in /modules/something/templates/any.tpl
        *
        * Even an empty module function would result in an rendering - a good starting point i guess!
        *
        */
        # Direct Path Assignments
        # a) call the template in root_tpl (themefolder) + path
        # This is also automagically called, when no template was set!
        #$this->setTemplate('index/show.tpl');
        # OR
        # b) directly call template in module path
        #$this->setTemplate( ROOT_MOD . '/index/templates/show.tpl' );

        # Starting the View
        #$this->setView($this->getRenderEngine());
