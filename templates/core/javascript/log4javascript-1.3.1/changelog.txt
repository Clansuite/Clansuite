log4javascript change log
-------------------------

1.3.1 (20/11/2006)
- Fix to interaction of search and severity filters in console window used by
  PopUpAppender and InPageAppender

1.3 (19/10/2006)
- Fully tested and supported in IE 7 Beta 3
- Added support for FireBug logging levels in BrowserConsoleAppender
- Added optional limit to the number of log messages stored by PopUpAppender and
  InPageAppender. When this limit is reached, each new message causes the oldest
  message to be discarded.
- Exceptions passed into logging methods are now displayed in logging output.
- Added facility to pass objects as well as strings to logging methods.
  Enhanced conversion character 'm' to PatternLayout to expand object properties
  in the formatted output
- Added stack trace to error reports (alerts and log entries) in Firefox. This
  is turned off by default but can be switched on via the new
  log4javascript.setShowStackTraces function
- Added log4javascript_stub.js to distribution - this has stub versions of all
  objects and methods in log4javascript.js and can be used as a lightweight
  replacement for log4javascript.js in production systems
- Added log4javascript_compressed.js to distribution - comments and whitespace
  are removed, resulting in a 30% smaller file
- Added custom fields to layouts
- Added setReopenWhenClosed and isReopenWhenClosed methods to PopUpAppender to
  allow log4javascript to open a new pop-up console window automatically at the
  time of the next log entry after the original window was closed
- Layout.ignoresThrowable implemented to allow Layout/Appender combinations to
  decide whether to display exceptions
- Added NullLayout that performs no formatting on the logging event
- Lowered BrowserConsoleAppender's default threshold to DEBUG and set its
  default layout to NullLayout so that unformatted objects can be passed into
  FireBug
- Renamed InlineAppender to InPageAppender (though InlineAppender still works
  for the sake of backwards compatibility)
- Cosmetic changes to InPageAppender and PopUpAppender
- Added equals() method to Level
- Added removeAppender() and removeAllAppenders() methods to Logger
- Added extensive test script
- Fixed bug where Appender.setLayout and Appender.setThreshold threw an
  unhandled error if not supplied with a genuine Layout or Level respectively
- Fixed bug where InlinePopUpAppender and PopUpAppender continue to poll their
  console windows indefinitely (thus generating warnings) if the console window
  is closed before it has fully loaded
- Fixed bug in w and W symbols in SimpleDateFormat
- Fixed bug with quotes inside messages in JsonLayout
- Fixed bugs in PatternLayout with built-in DATE format and truncation modifiers
- Changed execution order of callbacks in AjaxAppender so that
  requestSuccessCallback is guaranteed to be called before the next request is
  sent
- Changed AjaxAppender so that log messages are formatted immediately before
  a request is sent rather than when append() is called, thus guaranteeing that
  changes to the layout take effect immediately
- PopUpAppender windows now have unique names per hostname to prevent clashes
  from multiple instances of log4javascript running on different servers
- Fixed error in XmlLayout's format method when passed an object
- Fixed errors in JsonLayout's handling of strings containing line breaks and/or
  double quotes

1.2 (21/6/2006)
- Tested in and added workaround for a bug in Opera 9 Beta 2 and Opera 9.0
- Tested in Konqueror 3.4 and 3.5 and added workarounds and fixes for browser
  bugs
- Added addErrorListener and removeErrorListener methods to log4javascript
  object to allow custom error handling
- Added close() method to PopUpAppender and InlineAppender
- Added test directory with an HTML page containing automated tests
- Added enable/disable logging checkbox to InlinePopUpAppender and PopUpAppender
  so that unnecessary messages (for instance, from a timer) can be ignored
- An invalid value supplied to a configuration option setter now leaves config
  property unchanged rather than reverting to the default
- Fixed bug in PopUpAppender in IE on Windows XP Service Pack 2 when accessed
  via the file system. The browser by default disables JavaScript in the pop-up
  window until the user opts to enable it, at which point they would previously
  see an uncaught error in log4javascript. Now, a proper error message is
  displayed and the appender is disabled.
- Slight alterations to toolbar in InlinePopUpAppender and PopUpAppender - text
  capitalization and title attributes added to inputs
- toString() method added to all appenders
- correction to errors in XmlLayout's output
- documentation corrections and additions

1.1.1 (17/5/2006)
- Fixed a minor bug with scrolling to the latest message and added "scroll to
  latest" checkbox to console window in InlinePopUpAppender and PopUpAppender

1.1 (16/5/2006)
- Added configuration option setters on Appenders and refactored to prevent
  config properties being altered directly. Several configuration options
  may not be altered after the appender has been initialized
- Added scrollToLatestMessage constructor parameter, isScrollToLatestMessage
  and setScrollToLatestMessage methods to InlineAppender and PopUpAppender
- Added isVisible method to InlineAppender
- Changed setShowOneError to setAlertAllErrors in logLog, with obvious change
  in logic
- Added layout property key configuration options to layout constructors for 
  JsonLayout and HttpPostDataLayout
- Changed the default timestamp property name to "timestamp" instead of
  "timeStamp" in JsonLayout and HttpPostDataLayout
- Expanded documentation to include a section in the manual about configuring
  appenders
- Removed browser sniffing code

1.0.1 (30/4/2006)
- Option to have new log messages appear at the top added to InlineAppender and
  PopUpAppender. This option can be specified in the constructor and can also
  be toggled via a checkbox in the console window
- PopUpAppender changed to not focus the pop-up console window by default, and
  the demo page altered to create its own logger with focussing turned on,
  meaning the behaviour in the demo is essentially unchanged

1.0 (26/4/2006)
- Tweaks to default values in PopUpAppender and InlineAppender
- Bugfixes and stylistic tweaks resulting from running JSLint on
  log4javascript.js

1.0 beta 2
- Show/hide button removed from InlineAppender, replaced by show() and hide()
  methods on the InlineAppender object
- batchSeparator, batchHeader and batchFooter added to Layout and applied to
  JsonLayout - a batch of JSON log messages is now created as an array literal

- TRACE level added, since this was added to log4j in 1.2.12
- PopUpAppender default settings bugfix

- fixed getDefaultLogger and getNullLogger to return loggers other than the
  root logger

0.96
- moved console.html to inline document.writes in log4javascript.js
- fixed getDefaultLogger to return the same object on successive calls
- fixed scrolling issue in Opera InlineAppender and PopUpAppender

  InlineAppender and PopUpAppender
