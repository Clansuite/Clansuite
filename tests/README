  Tests Overview
  --------------

  We use Simpletest for running automated tests on the Clansuite Core.
  
  You can run all the complete Clansuite Testsuite (all tests) by calling
  /trunk/tests/runAllTests.php
  
  If you want to help, we are always looking to improve the Clansuite code coverage!  
  Please contact us at http://forum.clansuite.com

  WARNING: Don't use this in public environment.
           The "/tests" directory is removed on build.
