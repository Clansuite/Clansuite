  == Tests Overview

  We use Simpletest for running automated tests on the Clansuite Core.

  You can run all tests by calling /trunk/tests/runAllTests.php.
  That will run the complete Clansuite Testsuite.

  If you want to help, we are always looking to improve the Clansuite code coverage!
  Please contact us at http://forum.clansuite.com

  WARNING: Don't use this in public environment.
           The "/tests" directory is removed on build.
