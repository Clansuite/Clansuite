<p>
   The module name is misspelled or refers to a module that doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
    You have two options to solve this problem:
    <br />
    <em>
     <strong>Firstly</strong>, ensure that the name of the requested module is correct.
    <br />
     <strong>Secondly </strong>, create the module. Either manually or with the modulebuilder.

<!-- @todo http://www.clansuite.com/trac/ticket/146
     find a way to show the steps only if development mode is INACTIVE, else infos are useless
     -->
<!-- conditional needed here
<p>
    In regard to the later option you might consider setting Clansuite to "development mode".
    <br />
    This will then enhance this exception display and giving you the possibility to create the module
    by letting the modulebuilder guide you interactivly through the process of modulecreation.
