<p>
    This exception occurs, when the module and submodule and action you requested is not existing
    or simply incorrectly spelled.
    <br />
    The dispatcher is then unable to forward, because the routing to the requested module and action fails.
    <br />
    All names in the GET-Request have to be correctly spelled and must be resolveable to an existing module object
    and it's action.        
</p>

<p>
    <br />
    Please take the following actions
    <br />
    <em>
    firstly, ensure that the names in the GET-Request are correctly written
    <br />
    secondly, ensure that the requested module / submodule / action really exist
    </em>
    <br />
    to continue.
